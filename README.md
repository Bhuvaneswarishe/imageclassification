Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Project Overview

In this project, I built an advanced image classification system that categorizes images into different classes, such as animals (e.g., cats, dogs, snakes). Using cutting-edge deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning, the model achieves high accuracy and robustness in classification tasks.
